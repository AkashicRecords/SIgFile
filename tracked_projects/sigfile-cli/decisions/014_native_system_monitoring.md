# Decision: Use Native System Monitoring Tools

## Status
Draft | 2024-04-04 | AI Assistant | v1.0

## Context
We need to implement system monitoring for SigFile processes, but creating our own monitoring system would be:
- Resource intensive
- Less optimized than native tools
- Duplicative of existing functionality
- Platform-specific anyway

Native system monitoring tools like Activity Monitor (macOS) and Task Manager (Windows) are:
- Highly optimized
- Well-tested
- Platform-specific
- Already trusted by users

## Analysis

### Current State
- No native system monitoring integration
- Would need to implement our own monitoring
- Cross-platform compatibility challenges
- Resource overhead from custom implementation

### Requirements
1. Process monitoring
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Disk I/O
   - Network activity

2. Platform Support
   - macOS (Activity Monitor)
   - Windows (Task Manager)
   - Linux (top/htop)

3. Integration Needs
   - Command-line interface
   - API access
   - Real-time updates
   - Process filtering

### Options Considered

1. **Custom Implementation**
   - Pros:
     - Full control
     - Cross-platform consistency
     - Custom features
   - Cons:
     - High development cost
     - Performance overhead
     - Maintenance burden
     - Less optimized

2. **Native Tools Integration**
   - Pros:
     - Leverage existing tools
     - Better performance
     - Trusted by users
     - Platform optimization
   - Cons:
     - Platform-specific code
     - API limitations
     - Integration complexity

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Pros:
     - Best of both worlds
     - Fallback options
     - Flexibility
   - Cons:
     - More complex
     - Higher maintenance
     - Inconsistent experience

## Decision
We will implement a native system monitoring integration that:
1. Uses platform-specific monitoring tools
2. Provides a unified interface
3. Falls back to basic monitoring if needed

### Implementation Details

#### macOS Integration
- Use `ps` and `top` commands
- Access Activity Monitor data via `osascript`
- Monitor specific processes by PID
- Track resource usage metrics

#### Windows Integration
- Use `tasklist` and `wmic` commands
- Access Task Manager data via PowerShell
- Monitor process performance
- Track system metrics

#### Linux Integration
- Use `ps`, `top`, and `htop`
- Access system metrics via `/proc`
- Monitor process statistics
- Track resource utilization

### Affected Files
- `src/scripts/monitor/native_monitor.py`
- `src/scripts/monitor/macos_monitor.py`
- `src/scripts/monitor/windows_monitor.py`
- `src/scripts/monitor/linux_monitor.py`
- `src/scripts/monitor/base_monitor.py`
- `tests/test_native_monitor.py`

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Integration
1. Create base monitor interface
2. Implement macOS monitoring
3. Add Windows support
4. Add Linux support

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
1. Add process filtering
2. Implement metrics collection
3. Add alerting system
4. Create reporting tools

### Phase 3: Polish
1. Add documentation
2. Create usage examples
3. Add error handling
4. Implement fallbacks

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better performance
- Lower resource usage
- Trusted monitoring
- Platform optimization
- Reduced maintenance

### Negative
- Platform-specific code
- Integration complexity
- API limitations
- Learning curve

## Next Steps
1. Create base monitor interface
2. Implement macOS monitoring first
3. Add Windows support
4. Add Linux support
5. Create integration tests
