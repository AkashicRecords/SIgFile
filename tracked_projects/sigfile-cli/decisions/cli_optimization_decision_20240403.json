  "version": "0.1.0",
  "summary": "Decision to optimize the SigFile CLI by creating a separate package with a base command class to reduce code redundancy and improve maintainability.",
  "context": {
    "problem": "The CLI implementation had redundant code across different commands, making it difficult to maintain and extend. Each command was implementing similar functionality for file operations, error handling, and validation.",
    "solution": "Create a separate Python package for the CLI with a base command class that handles common operations. This approach centralizes common functionality and allows each command to focus on its specific logic.",
    "impact": "This change improves code maintainability, reduces duplication, and makes it easier to add new commands in the future. It also ensures consistent behavior across all commands."

  "technical_details": {
    "architecture": "The CLI is now structured as a separate Python package with a clear separation of concerns. The BaseCommand class provides common functionality, while specific command classes handle their unique logic.",
    "implementation": "Each command inherits from BaseCommand and implements its specific methods. The main CLI module uses these command classes to handle user input and execute commands.",
    "dependencies": "The CLI package depends on click for command-line interface, rich for terminal formatting, and gitpython for developer ID detection."
  },
  "usage_instructions": "To use the CLI, install it with pip: pip install sigfile-cli. Then use commands like 'sigfile decision -n -t \"Title\" -y architectural -p high' or 'sigfile decision' for interactive mode.",
  "future_considerations": [
    "Add more commands using the base class structure",
    "Implement command history and undo functionality",
    "Add support for command aliases",
    "Enhance the interactive mode with more features"
