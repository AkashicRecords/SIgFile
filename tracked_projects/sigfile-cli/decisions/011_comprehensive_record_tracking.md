# Decision: Implement Comprehensive Development Lifecycle Tracking

## Status
- Status: Draft
- Date: 2024-04-04
- Author: AI Assistant
- Version: 1.0

## Context
We need to track the entire development lifecycle from initial conversations and decisions through to final release and testing. This will provide:
1. Complete traceability of changes
2. Automated record keeping
3. Integration with existing tools
4. Comprehensive documentation

## Analysis

### Current State
- Basic record creation implemented
- CLI tools for manual input
- Limited automation
- No integration with CI/CD
- No release tracking

### Requirements
1. **Conversation Tracking**
   - Local development discussions
   - AI interactions
   - Team communications
   - Decision rationale

2. **Development Process**
   - Code changes
   - Commit messages
   - Branch management
   - Pull requests

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Build results
   - Test outcomes
   - Deployment status
   - Environment updates

4. **Release Management**
   - Version tracking
   - Release notes
   - Testing results
   - Deployment verification

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive tracking system with the following components:

1. **Local Development Tracking**
   ```python
   class DevelopmentTracker:
       def track_conversation(self, message: str, context: Dict):
           """Track development discussions"""
           
       def track_decision(self, decision: Decision):
           """Track development decisions"""
           
       def track_change(self, change: Change):
           """Track code changes"""
   ```

2. **Version Control Integration**
   ```python
   class VCSIntegration:
       def track_commit(self, commit: Commit):
           """Track version control commits"""
           
       def track_branch(self, branch: Branch):
           """Track branch management"""
           
       def track_pr(self, pr: PullRequest):
           """Track pull requests"""
   ```

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   ```python
   class CI/CDIntegration:
       def track_build(self, build: Build):
           """Track build results"""
           
       def track_test(self, test: Test):
           """Track test results"""
           
       def track_deployment(self, deployment: Deployment):
           """Track deployment status"""
   ```

4. **Release Management**
   ```python
   class ReleaseManager:
       def track_version(self, version: Version):
           """Track version updates"""
           
       def track_release(self, release: Release):
           """Track release process"""
           
       def track_verification(self, verification: Verification):
           """Track release verification"""
   ```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Local Development (Current)**
   - [x] Basic record creation
   - [x] CLI interface
   - [ ] Conversation tracking
   - [ ] Decision tracking
   - [ ] Change tracking

2. **Phase 2: Version Control (Next)**
   - [ ] Commit tracking
   - [ ] Branch tracking
   - [ ] PR tracking
   - [ ] Integration hooks

3. **Phase 3: CI/CD (Planned)**
   - [ ] Build tracking
   - [ ] Test tracking
   - [ ] Deployment tracking
   - [ ] Environment tracking

4. **Phase 4: Release (Future)**
   - [ ] Version tracking
   - [ ] Release tracking
   - [ ] Verification tracking
   - [ ] Documentation generation
