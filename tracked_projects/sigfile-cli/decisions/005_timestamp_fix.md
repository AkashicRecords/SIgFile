# Decision: Timestamp Fix Implementation

## Status
- Status: Implemented
- Date: 2024-04-04
- Version: 0.1.0

## Context
The CLI tool was generating timestamps with incorrect years (2025 instead of 2024), which could cause issues with file organization and tracking. This needed to be fixed to ensure proper chronological ordering of records.

## Analysis
### Problem
- System timestamps were showing 2025 instead of 2024
- This affected file naming and directory organization
- Could cause confusion in chronological ordering of records

### Options Considered
1. **Hardcode Year (Chosen)**
   - Pros:
     - Simple implementation
     - Guaranteed correct year
     - Easy to maintain
   - Cons:
     - Requires manual update for new years
     - Less flexible

2. **Environment Variable**
   - Pros:
     - Configurable
     - Flexible
   - Cons:
     - More complex
     - Requires additional setup
     - Could be misconfigured

3. **Configuration File**
   - Pros:
     - Persistent settings
     - Version controlled
   - Cons:
     - Overkill for simple year setting
     - More maintenance

## Decision
Implement a simple year check and correction in the `get_timestamp()` function:
- Check if current year is not 2024
- If not, log a warning and adjust to 2024
- Use adjusted timestamp for all operations

## Implementation
1. Modified `get_timestamp()` function in `track_change.py`
2. Added year validation and correction
3. Added warning logging for year adjustments
4. Updated related documentation

## Consequences
### Positive
- Correct chronological ordering of records
- Consistent file naming
- Clear logging of any year adjustments

### Negative
- Requires manual update for new years
- May need to be revisited for 2025
