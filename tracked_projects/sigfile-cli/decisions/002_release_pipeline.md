# Decision: Release Pipeline and Build Definitions

## Status
- Date: 2024-04-04
- Type: Implementation
- Status: Approved and Implemented

## Context
During the development of SigFile-CLI, we identified the need for a robust release pipeline that:
1. Supports both development and release builds
2. Implements CI/CD best practices
3. Ensures code quality and security
4. Automates the release process

## Analysis

### Requirements
1. **Development Build:**
   - Multi-python version testing
   - Linting and type checking
   - Security scanning
   - Development package build
   - Debug capabilities

2. **Release Build:**
   - Release package build
   - Security scanning
   - Performance testing
   - PyPI publishing
   - Version management

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Single Pipeline
**Pros:**
- Simpler configuration
- Unified workflow
- Easier maintenance

**Cons:**
- Less flexibility
- Potential performance impact
- Mixed concerns

#### Option 2: Separate Pipelines
**Pros:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Optimized for each use case
- Better performance
- More control

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Additional maintenance
- Need to sync configurations

## Decision
**Implementation: Separate Development and Release Pipelines**

### Affected Code

1. **Development Pipeline (.github/workflows/development.yml):**
   ```yaml
   name: Development Pipeline
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main, develop ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main, develop ]
   
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       strategy:
         matrix:
           python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v2
           with:
             python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             python -m pip install --upgrade pip
             pip install -e .[dev]
         - name: Run tests
           run: pytest
         - name: Run linting
           run: flake8
         - name: Run type checking
           run: mypy .
         - name: Security scan
           run: bandit -r .
         - name: Build development package
           run: python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   ```

2. **Release Pipeline (.github/workflows/release.yml):**
   ```yaml
   name: Release Pipeline
   on:
     release:
       types: [published]
   
   jobs:
     release:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v2
           with:
             python-version: '3.10'
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             python -m pip install --upgrade pip
             pip install -e .[release]
         - name: Run security scan
           run: bandit -r .
         - name: Run performance tests
           run: pytest tests/performance
         - name: Build release package
           run: python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
         - name: Publish to PyPI
           uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@v1.4.2
           with:
             password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
   ```

3. **Build Configuration (config/build_config.py):**
   ```python
   class BuildConfig:
       @staticmethod
       def get_config(is_dev_build):
           if is_dev_build:
               return {
                   'optimization_level': 0,
                   'debug': True,
                   'strip': False,
                   'include_tests': True
               }
           return {
               'optimization_level': 2,
               'debug': False,
               'strip': True,
               'include_tests': False
           }
   ```
