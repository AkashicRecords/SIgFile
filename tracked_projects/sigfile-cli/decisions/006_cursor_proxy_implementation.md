# Decision: Cursor Traffic Proxy Implementation

## Status
- Status: Pending Implementation
- Date: 2024-04-04
- Version: 0.1.0

## Context
We need to capture and track AI conversations and thinking processes from Cursor interactions. Direct integration with Cursor's API is not feasible, so we need an alternative approach to capture this data.

## Analysis
### Problem
- Need to capture AI conversations and thinking processes
- Direct API access to Cursor is not available
- Need to maintain conversation context and metadata
- Must ensure data privacy and security

### Options Considered
1. **Traffic Proxy (Chosen)**
   - Pros:
     - Can capture all Cursor traffic
     - No modification to Cursor required
     - Can filter and process data in real-time
     - Maintains conversation context
   - Cons:
     - Requires additional infrastructure
     - More complex implementation
     - Need to handle SSL/TLS properly

2. **Log File Analysis**
   - Pros:
     - Simpler implementation
     - No additional infrastructure
   - Cons:
     - Limited to available log data
     - May miss real-time context
     - Dependent on log format

3. **Direct Integration**
   - Pros:
     - Clean integration
     - Real-time data access
   - Cons:
     - Not possible without Cursor API access
     - Would require Cursor modifications

## Decision
Implement a traffic proxy that:
1. Intercepts Cursor traffic
2. Filters for AI conversations and thinking processes
3. Extracts relevant data:
   - Conversation content
   - Thinking processes
   - Model responses
   - Context and metadata
4. Stores data in structured format
5. Maintains conversation context

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up proxy server
2. Implement SSL/TLS handling
3. Create traffic filtering rules
4. Develop data extraction logic
5. Implement storage system
6. Add context tracking
7. Test with various Cursor interactions

## Consequences
### Positive

- Real-time data processing
- Structured data storage
- Context preservation
- No Cursor modifications needed

### Negative
- Additional infrastructure required
- More complex implementation
- Need to handle security properly
- Potential performance impact
