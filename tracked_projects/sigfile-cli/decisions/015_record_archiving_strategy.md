# Decision: Record Archiving Strategy

## Status
Draft | 2024-04-04 | AI Assistant | v1.0

## Context
As the SigFile system grows, we need a strategy to manage record storage and maintain system performance. Key considerations:
- Record size limits
- Storage optimization
- Access patterns
- Performance impact
- Data retention
- Recovery needs

## Analysis

### Current State
- No size limits on records
- All records stored in active storage
- No archiving mechanism
- Potential performance degradation
- Storage space concerns
- Backup complexity

### Requirements
1. Storage Management
   - Size limits per record
   - Total storage limits
   - Archive thresholds
   - Compression options

2. Access Patterns
   - Recent record access
   - Historical data needs
   - Search requirements
   - Recovery speed

3. Performance
   - System responsiveness
   - Query performance
   - Storage efficiency
   - Resource usage

4. Data Management
   - Retention policies
   - Archive formats
   - Indexing strategy
   - Recovery procedures

### Options Considered

1. **Time-Based Archiving**
   - Pros:
     - Simple implementation
     - Predictable behavior
     - Easy to understand
   - Cons:
     - May not reflect actual usage
     - Could archive frequently accessed data
     - Rigid structure

2. **Size-Based Archiving**
   - Pros:
     - Direct storage management
     - Performance optimization
     - Clear thresholds
   - Cons:
     - Complex implementation
     - May split related records
     - Requires careful tuning

3. **Usage-Based Archiving**
   - Pros:
     - Reflects actual usage
     - Optimizes for access patterns
     - Flexible approach
   - Cons:
     - Complex tracking
     - Resource intensive
     - Hard to predict

## Decision
We will implement a hybrid archiving strategy that combines:
1. Size-based thresholds
2. Usage patterns
3. Time-based policies
4. Compression options

### Implementation Details

#### Size Limits
- Individual record: 10MB
- Project total: 1GB
- Archive threshold: 80% of limit

#### Archiving Rules
1. **Automatic Archiving**
   - Size threshold reached
   - Time-based (6 months old)
   - Low access frequency
   - System resource constraints

2. **Archive Format**
   - Compressed JSON
   - Metadata index
   - Searchable content
   - Quick recovery

3. **Storage Structure**
   ```
   /active/
     /records/
     /projects/
   /archive/
     /year/
       /month/
         /compressed/
         /index/
   ```

4. **Access Patterns**
   - Recent records: Direct access
   - Archived records: On-demand
   - Search: Index-based
   - Recovery: Priority-based

### Affected Files
- `src/scripts/storage/archive_manager.py`
- `src/scripts/storage/compression.py`
- `src/scripts/storage/index_manager.py`
- `src/scripts/storage/recovery.py`
- `src/scripts/models/record.py`
- `tests/test_archive_manager.py`

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Archiving
1. Implement size limits
2. Create archive format
3. Add compression
4. Build index system

### Phase 2: Access Management
1. Implement access patterns
2. Add recovery system
3. Create search interface
4. Build monitoring

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Performance tuning
2. Resource management
3. User feedback
4. System monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better performance
- Reduced storage needs
- Optimized access
- Scalable system

### Negative
- Implementation complexity
- Recovery overhead
- Learning curve
- Maintenance needs

## Next Steps
1. Create archive manager
2. Implement compression
3. Build index system
4. Add recovery tools
5. Create monitoring
