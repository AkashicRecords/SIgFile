# Decision: CLI Tool Debugging Strategy

## Status
- Date: 2024-04-04
- Type: Pending
- Status: Draft

## Context
During the development of SigFile-CLI, we need to determine the best approach for debugging command execution failures. This decision will impact:
1. Development workflow efficiency
2. Issue resolution time
3. User support capabilities
4. Maintenance overhead

## Analysis

### Requirements
1. **Development Debugging:**
   - Command execution tracking
   - Error context capture
   - Performance monitoring
   - State inspection

2. **Production Debugging:**
   - User error reporting
   - Environment information
   - Safe logging
   - Issue reproduction

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Manual Debugging
**Pros:**
- Full control over debugging process
- No additional dependencies
- Simple implementation

**Cons:**
- Time-consuming
- Prone to human error
- Difficult to reproduce issues
- Limited context capture

#### Option 2: Integrated Logging
**Pros:**
- Automated context capture
- Consistent debugging process
- Better issue reproduction
- Historical data

**Cons:**
- Additional complexity
- Performance impact
- Storage requirements
- Security considerations

## Decision
**Pending Implementation**

### Next Steps
1. **Short Term:**
   - Implement basic command execution tracking
   - Add error context capture
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Create state inspection tools

2. **Medium Term:**
   - Develop user error reporting
   - Implement environment information capture
   - Add safe logging capabilities
   - Create issue reproduction tools

3. **Long Term:**
   - Optimize performance impact
   - Enhance security features
   - Add analytics capabilities
   - Implement automated issue resolution

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved debugging capabilities
- Better issue resolution
- Enhanced user support
- Reduced maintenance time

### Negative
- Additional complexity
- Performance overhead
- Storage requirements
- Security considerations
