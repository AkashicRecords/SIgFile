  "summary": "Implementation of a separate Python package for the SigFile CLI with optimized code structure and comprehensive documentation.",
  "context": {
    "problem": "The CLI implementation needed to be separated from the main application to allow independent versioning and updates. Additionally, the code had redundancy that needed to be addressed.",
    "solution": "Create a separate Python package for the CLI with a base command class to reduce code redundancy and improve maintainability. Implement comprehensive documentation for users and developers.",
    "impact": "This change improves code maintainability, reduces duplication, and makes it easier to add new commands in the future. It also ensures consistent behavior across all commands and provides clear documentation for users and developers."
