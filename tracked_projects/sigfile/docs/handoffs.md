# SigFile Handoff Documents

This directory contains handoff documents that provide context and information about significant changes, decisions, and implementations in the SigFile project. These documents are designed to be easily ingested by LLMs (Large Language Models) to understand the project's evolution and current state.

## Document Format

Handoff documents are stored in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Brief title of the change or decision",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "version": "X.Y.Z",
  "summary": "One-sentence summary of the change",

```

## Purpose

These handoff documents serve several purposes:

1. **Documentation**: They provide detailed documentation of significant changes and decisions.
2. **Context Preservation**: They preserve the context and reasoning behind changes.
3. **LLM Ingestion**: They are structured to be easily ingested by LLMs for understanding the project.
4. **Onboarding**: They help new team members understand the project's evolution.
5. **Decision Tracking**: They track important decisions and their rationale.
6. **Code History**: They preserve important code snippets to understand the evolution of the codebase.
7. **System State**: They capture the system state at the time of the change for better reproducibility and debugging.
8. **Roadmap**: They document upcoming features and future plans for the project.

## Creating New Handoff Documents

When creating a new handoff document:

1. Use a descriptive filename that reflects the content (e.g., `virtual_environment_setup.json`).
2. Follow the JSON structure outlined above.
3. Be thorough in describing the context, changes, and impact.
4. Include relevant technical details and usage instructions.
5. Consider future implications and related documents.
6. Include relevant code snippets showing before and after states of important changes.
7. Always include the system state section with current environment information.
8. Document any upcoming features related to the change.

## Using Handoff Documents

These documents can be used by:

- LLMs to understand the project context and make informed suggestions
- Developers to understand past decisions and implementations
- Project managers to track progress and decisions
- New team members to get up to speed on the project
- Debugging teams to understand the system state during changes
- Product managers to understand the roadmap and upcoming features
