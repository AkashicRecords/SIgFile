Document 2: SigFile - Sales & Marketing Strategy

1. Target Audience

Phase 1/2 (Bottom-up Adoption): Individual Developers, Small Teams, Open Source Projects. Focus on tech forums (Reddit, Hacker News), GitHub, personal blogs, developer communities.

Phase 3/4 (Top-down & Bottom-up): Team Leads, Engineering Managers, Architects, CTOs, Security/Compliance Officers in mid-to-large enterprises. Focus shifts to direct outreach, case studies, potentially partnerships, targeted content marketing.

2. Core Value Proposition

Problem: Lost context, repeated mistakes, slow onboarding, lack of verifiable rationale behind code changes. The unique "signature" thinking of developers evaporates.

Solution: SigFile captures, secures (via digital signatures), and makes accessible the developer signature (intent, rationale, decisions) linked directly to code history.

Key Pillars:

Preserve Knowledge: Stop losing the "why". Build a permanent, searchable team brain.

Increase Efficiency: Faster onboarding, debugging, code reviews. Avoid wasted effort on rejected paths.

Improve Quality & Security: Leverage past learnings, enforce standards, provide verifiable audit trail with digital signatures.

Empower Developers: Validate and give weight to their "signature" contributions.

3. Naming & Branding

Name: SigFile

Core Concept: "Sig" = Signature (Developer's unique thinking, rationale, style).

Messaging: Emphasize capturing "developer signatures," "code intent," "verifiable rationale," "institutional memory," "the why behind the commit." Use the "Did you check the sigfile?" angle. Highlight the "YOLO mode" audit trail capability.

4. Taglines (Evolving)

Initial (Developer Focus):

SigFile: Capture Your Code's Signature Intent.

SigFile: The Verifiable Log for Developer Decisions.

Stop Guessing Why. Start Signing with SigFile.

Later (Enterprise Focus):

SigFile: Secure Your Development Knowledge.

SigFile: Verifiable Intelligence Preservation for Engineering Teams.

The Audit Trail for Human and AI Code Contributions.

5. Go-to-Market Strategy (Phased)

Phase 1 (Alpha): Launch on GitHub. Post on relevant forums (Show HN, Reddit /r/programming, etc.). Focus on attracting early adopters, getting feedback on the core CLI workflow. Build an initial community (Discord/Slack?).

Phase 2 (Beta): Announce Beta program. Actively solicit feedback. Publish blog posts detailing the vision and benefits. Refine features based on feedback. Potentially offer early basic IDE plugin. Grow community.

Phase 3 (V1.0 - Commercial/Open Core): Launch commercial offering alongside the open-source core. Focus on teams needing self-hosting and basic agent features. Offer paid support/consulting for deployment. Start content marketing targeting team leads/managers.

Phase 4 (V2.0 - Enterprise Sales): Direct sales efforts targeting enterprise clients. Develop case studies. Attend relevant conferences. Build partnerships. Highlight security (signatures, customer-hosted), compliance, and ROI (time saved, mistakes prevented).

6. Pricing Model Considerations (For Phase 3+)

Open Core: Keep the core CLI tool and basic file/SQLite storage open source (MIT).

Team/Professional Tier: Per-seat license for features like IDE plugins, advanced search, basic agent capabilities, team collaboration features (if built), standard support.

Enterprise Tier: Custom pricing based on seats/usage. Includes all features: customer-hosted deployment support, SSO, RBAC, admin dashboard, premium support, proactive agent features, security/compliance features.

7. Competitor Awareness

Direct: Currently few tools focus specifically on logging developer rationale with Git linking and digital signatures.

Indirect: Git commit messages, code comments, wiki pages (Confluence, Notion), ticketing systems (Jira), chat logs (Slack).

Differentiation: SigFile is purpose-built, links directly to code state (Git), provides structure, ensures verifiability (signatures), enables semantic search/AI features on rationale, and offers a security-focused customer-hosted model. Emphasize the proactive agent and "signature" preservation.
