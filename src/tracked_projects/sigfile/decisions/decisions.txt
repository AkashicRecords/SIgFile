# Sigfile Project Decisions

## 1. File Archiving System
- Status: Undecided
- Date: 20240319
- Type: Technical
- Priority: Medium
- Context: Need to manage file growth and system performance for tracked changes
- Options:
  1. Immediate Implementation
     - Pros: Early performance optimization
     - Cons: Added complexity, may be premature
  2. Delayed Implementation
     - Pros: Focus on core functionality first
     - Cons: Potential future performance issues
  3. Hybrid Approach
     - Pros: Balance immediate needs with future scalability
     - Cons: More complex implementation
- Current Decision: Pending
- Rationale: Need more data on file growth patterns and stability of core functionality
- Next Steps:
  1. Monitor file growth patterns
  2. Document usage scenarios
  3. Revisit decision with more data
  4. Consider alternative approaches

## 2. File Mutability System
- Status: Decided
- Date: 20240319
- Type: Technical
- Priority: High
- Context: Need to protect certain files from modification while allowing others to be updated
- Decision: Implement selective mutability
- Implementation:
  1. Backup files: Immutable after creation
  2. Handoff files: Immutable after creation
  3. Change files: Mutable until explicitly finalized
- Rationale: Provides necessary protection while maintaining flexibility

## 3. Decision Tracking System
- Status: Decided
- Date: 20240319
- Type: Process
- Priority: High
- Context: Need to track and document project decisions
- Decision: Implement structured decision tracking
- Implementation:
  1. JSON-based decision records
  2. Standardized format
  3. Status tracking
  4. Impact analysis
- Rationale: Ensures decisions are properly documented and tracked
- Tags: documentation, process, implementation
