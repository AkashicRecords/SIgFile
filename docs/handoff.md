# SigFile.ai Development Handoff - 2024 Q1

## Project Context
SigFile.ai emerged from the need to track and understand AI-assisted development changes, particularly in Cursor IDE. The primary goal is to preserve not just what changed, but why changes were made, capturing the entire development thought process.

## Core Features Implementation Status

### 1. AI Development Memory
**Status: Partially Implemented**
- ✅ Basic change tracking structure
- ✅ Project organization by chat sessions
- ❌ Automatic Cursor chat logging
- ❌ Real-time change monitoring

**Next Steps:**
- Implement automatic chat capture from Cursor
- Add real-time monitoring of IDE changes
- Link conversations to specific code changes

### 2. Dataset Generation Pipeline
**Status: Design Phase**
- ✅ Basic JSON data structure
- ✅ Project-based organization
- ❌ JSONL export for fine-tuning
- ❌ Data cleaning system

**Next Steps:**
- Implement JSONL export functionality
- Add data cleaning options
- Create filtering system by tags
- Add sensitive data detection

### 3. Development Context System
**Status: In Progress**
- ✅ Basic logging structure
- ✅ Project separation
- ❌ AI thinking capture
- ❌ Decision tree logging

**Next Steps:**
- Complete thinking process documentation
- Implement decision tracking
- Add impact assessment
- Create context linking system

## Critical Implementation Details

### AI Chat Integration
```powershell
Track-AISession
├── Session metadata
├── Conversation history
├── Code changes
└── Decision context
```

### Dataset Export Structure
```json
{
  "conversation": {
    "context": "Development session context",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}
    ],
    "decisions": {
      "reasoning": "Why this change was made",
      "impact": ["affected_files"],
      "alternatives": ["other_options"]
    }
  }
}
```
